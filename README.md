This project consists of a spam classifier developed using Machine Learning techniques, based on a practical exercise from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aur√©lien G√©ron.

The goal is to train models capable of distinguishing between legitimate emails (ham) and spam with high precision and recall, through a preprocessing pipeline and evaluation of multiple classification algorithms.

**NOTE: Some of the cells may take a while to run, please be patient!**

## üìÇ Data Used

The data used for training and testing the models comes from the [SpamAssassin Public Corpus](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/), a collection of spam and ham emails publicly available for spam filter research.
